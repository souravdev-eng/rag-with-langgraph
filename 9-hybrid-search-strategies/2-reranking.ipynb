    "**FlashRank** is an ultra-lite & super-fast Python library for re-ranking search results using state-of-the-art cross-encoders. It's much faster than using an LLM for reranking and provides better accuracy than simple vector similarity.\n",

    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. Use a fast retriever (like FAISS) to get top-k documents\n",
    "2. FlashRank re-ranks them using a cross-encoder model\n",
    "3. Returns the most relevant documents at the top\n",

    "- `FlashrankRerank` — Cross-encoder reranking (what you're using)\n",
    "- `LLMChainExtractor` — Uses an LLM to extract relevant parts\n",
    "- `LLMChainFilter` — Uses an LLM to filter documents\n",
    "- `EmbeddingsFilter` — Filters by embedding similarity threshold\n",
    "- `CohereRerank` — Cohere's reranking API\n",
    "- `LLMLinguaCompressor` — Compresses documents using LLMLingua\n",
